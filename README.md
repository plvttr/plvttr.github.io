1.
	I completed all the requirements of the assignment as far as I know. 

	index.html (for github), resume.html, and bio.html all passed the validator with no errors (index.html had a few warnings).

	index.html (for cs.tufts.edu) did result in an error from the validator, but the code in question was copied exactly from your HTML guide on URL redirection with only the URL changed.

	resume-style.cc and bio-style.css both passed the css validator without any errors or warnings.

	As a note, the links to my resume.html and bio.html are in the form of (hopefully) self-explanatory icons.

2. 
	I asked Frankie Hattler a couple questions before starting this assignment.

3.
	Time spent on this project: approximately 3.5 hours.
