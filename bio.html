<h1>Bio for Paul Vetter</h1>

<p>My name is Paul Vetter. I'm a computer science major who is also following a pre-med track at Tufts University.</p>

<p>I'm from Northern California. I decided to go to school on the East coast to have the experience of beautiful fall, freezing winter, and refreshing spring. A couple hobbies of mine include playing lacrosse and the guitar.</p>
